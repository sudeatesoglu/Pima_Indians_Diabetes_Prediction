# Analysis Expectation
A machine learning model is requested to be developed that can predict whether individuals have diabetes or not when their features are specified.

# Story of the Dataset
The dataset is a subset of a large dataset maintained by the National Institute of Diabetes, Digestive, and Kidney Diseases in the United States. It is utilized for a diabetes research study conducted on Pima Indian women, aged 21 and above, residing in Phoenix, the fifth-largest city in Arizona. The target variable is defined as "outcome," indicating that 1 represents a positive outcome in the diabetes test, while 0 represents a negative outcome.

- **Pregnancies:** Number of pregnancies
- **Glucose:** Plasma glucose concentration after 2 hours in an oral glucose tolerance test
- **Blood Pressure:** Blood Pressure (Diastolic) (mm Hg)
- **SkinThickness:** Skin Thickness
- **Insulin:** Serum insulin level after 2 hours (mu U/ml)
- **DiabetesPedigreeFunction:** Diabetes pedigree function (a function related to the diabetes history in family)
- **BMI:** Body Mass Index
- **Age:** Age (years)
